# Self-Assessment Rubrics

Rate yourself honestly on each skill. Use the scale to identify strengths and gaps, then focus your practice on areas scored 1-3.

**Rating Scale:**
- **1 — No idea:** Have not encountered this concept yet
- **2 — Seen it:** Recognize the concept but cannot apply it independently
- **3 — Can do with help:** Can accomplish this with documentation or examples open
- **4 — Confident:** Can do this from memory in most situations
- **5 — Can teach it:** Could explain this clearly to someone else and handle edge cases

## Levels 0-2: Beginner

### Core Python Fluency

| # | Skill | Rating (1-5) |
|---|-------|:---:|
| 1 | Can I write a function from scratch without copying an example? | ___ |
| 2 | Can I read an error traceback and identify which line caused the problem? | ___ |
| 3 | Can I explain what my code does, line by line, to someone else? | ___ |
| 4 | Can I choose between a list, dict, and set for a given problem? | ___ |
| 5 | Can I write a for loop and a while loop and know when to use each? | ___ |

## How to Use This Assessment

1. **Take it honestly.** There is no grade — this is for your own planning.
2. **Retake every 2-4 weeks** to track growth. Date your assessments.
3. **Focus practice** on your lowest-scoring items within your current tier.
4. **Do not skip ahead** to a higher tier until you hit the milestone for your current one.
5. **Use the projects** — each curriculum level is designed to build the skills listed above.
