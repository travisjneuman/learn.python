# Walkthrough Index

Step-by-step build guides that show the **thinking process** for key projects at every level. Walkthroughs do not give you the answer — they guide your thinking so you can build the solution yourself.

Each walkthrough covers: understanding the problem, planning before code, building incrementally, common mistakes, and testing strategies.

---

## How to Use Walkthroughs

1. **Try the project first.** Spend at least 20 minutes before opening the walkthrough.
2. **Read for the thinking, not the code.** Walkthroughs show how to break problems down, not full solutions.
3. **Stop and predict** at each "Predict before you scroll" prompt.
4. **If you need the full solution**, see the SOLUTION.md file in the same project directory.
