# 18 - Remediation Playbook
Home: [README](./README.md)

This document defines how to recover learners who stall, fail repeatedly, or lose confidence.

## Core principle
Failure is expected. Unstructured failure is the problem. This playbook provides structure.

## Remediation triggers
- same error repeated 3+ sessions,
- no project completion in 2 weeks,
- confidence drop reported in checkpoints,
- inability to explain recent code changes.

## Remediation flow
1. Diagnose failure type
- knowledge gap,
- workflow/tooling gap,
- confidence gap,
- environment/setup gap.

2. Apply targeted intervention
- 30-minute focused micro-lab,
- one guided break/fix drill,
- one reflection prompt,
- one small “win” task.

3. Reassess after 3 sessions
- if stable: resume standard track,
- if unstable: step down one level temporarily.

## Common failure patterns by stage
- Levels 0-2:
  - path mistakes,
  - type conversion confusion,
  - loop logic confusion.
- Levels 3-6:
  - weak module boundaries,
  - missing tests,
  - brittle transformations.
- Levels 7-10:
  - system complexity overload,
  - poor observability,
  - weak failure-mode planning.

## Recovery templates
- root-cause template,
- fix-plan template,
- confidence rebuild checklist,
- level re-entry checklist.
