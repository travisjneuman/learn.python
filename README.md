## I Don't Know Python. So I Built This.

I wanted to learn Python. When I looked for resources, I hit the same wall a lot of people hit: most Python courses are either too shallow (build a calculator and call it a day) or too academic (here's a lecture on Big-O notation before you've written a for loop). Nothing matched how I actually learn — by building real things, breaking them, and understanding why they broke.

So I built the curriculum I wished existed. Then I open-sourced it, because if it helps me learn Python, maybe it helps you too.

**This is a complete, hands-on Python curriculum. From "what is a terminal?" to deploying production applications. 274 projects. Every learning style supported. Go at your own pace.**

---

## What Makes This Different

**Every learning style is first-class.** Read concepts, build projects, watch walkthroughs, test with quizzes, review with flashcards, visualize with diagrams, or try code in the browser — all following the same path. However you learn best, there's a way through this curriculum for you.

**You build real things.** 274 projects, not toy examples. Every project has tests, starter code, and challenges that force you past copy-paste into actual understanding.

**You go at your own pace.** This isn't a bootcamp with deadlines. Follow the click chain, take breaks, come back. The spaced repetition system tracks what you've forgotten so you can review efficiently.

**Every step is connected.** Every document, concept guide, project, quiz, walkthrough, and challenge is linked through a single click chain with a "Learn Your Way" navigation table at every stop. Start at the beginning and follow the "Next" links. That's it.

Not sure how you learn best? Take the [Learning Style Selector](./guides/LEARNING_STYLE_SELECTOR.md) quiz to get a personalized path through the material.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/travisjneuman/learn.python.git
cd learn.python
```

Open [START_HERE.md](./START_HERE.md) and follow the guide. You'll be writing Python in under 10 minutes.

Never used a terminal before? Start with [00_COMPUTER_LITERACY_PRIMER.md](./00_COMPUTER_LITERACY_PRIMER.md) — it explains everything from scratch.

Not sure how to use this curriculum? Read the [Getting Started Guide](./GETTING_STARTED.md). Have questions? Check the [FAQ](./FAQ.md).

## Curriculum Roadmap

The curriculum is a straight line from zero experience to production-grade engineering. Every stage builds on the last.

| Stage | Docs | What You Learn | Projects |
|-------|------|----------------|----------|
| **Absolute Beginner** | 00-03 | What is a terminal, how to install Python, first commands | 15 exercises |
| **Foundations** | 04 | Variables, loops, functions, files, errors, collections | 15 projects |
| **Quality & Testing** | 09 | pytest, ruff, black, writing tests that catch real bugs | 15 projects |
| **Intermediate Python** | 05-08 | Excel/CSV automation, SQL basics, data pipelines | 60 projects |
| **Professional Practices** | 10-12 | Packages, logging, refactoring, dependency management | 45 projects |

| **Elite Track** | Curriculum 16-50 | Architecture, observability, resilience, security, cost modeling | 10 projects |
| **Expansion Modules** | 12 modules | Web scraping through cloud deployment — real libraries, real tools | 56 projects |

**Total: 274 projects across 13 levels and 12 technology modules.**

See the full [Curriculum Map](./CURRICULUM_MAP.md) for a dependency diagram and every project listed at a glance.

## Choose Your Learning Mode

**Play-First (Builder)** — Open a project, tinker, break things, figure it out. Read the concept doc when you get stuck. Watch the walkthrough only if you're truly blocked. Good for people who learn by doing.

**Structured (Reader)** — Read the concept doc, take the quiz, then do the projects in order. Use the checklist and mastery gates. Good for people who like clear progress markers.

**Watch-First (Watcher)** — Watch the curated video for each concept, read the walkthrough to see the thinking process, then build the project. Good for people who learn by observing first.

**Visual-First (Visualizer)** — Start with the Mermaid diagrams to see the big picture, read the concept guide with the diagram as your mental map, then build. Good for people who think in pictures and systems.

**Hybrid (Recommended)** — Follow the structured path on weekdays. Explore expansion modules and challenges on weekends. Review flashcards daily. Mix modalities as needed.

Take the [Learning Style Selector](./guides/LEARNING_STYLE_SELECTOR.md) to find your best starting approach.

## Concept Guides & Practice Tools

**34 concept guides** explain core ideas in plain language — from variables and loops through decorators, async/await, and security. Most have matching quizzes. See the [full concept index](./concepts/README.md).

**34 quizzes** — one per concept guide. Run them from the terminal:
```bash
python concepts/quizzes/what-is-a-variable-quiz.py
```

**24 flashcard decks** — spaced repetition using a Leitner box system. Cards you get right appear less often. Cards you miss come back immediately.
```bash
python practice/flashcards/review-runner.py
```

**30 coding challenges** — 10 to 30 minutes each. 15 beginner, 15 intermediate.
```bash
python practice/challenges/beginner/01-swap-variables.py
```

Plus diagnostic assessments, an auto-grader, and a progress dashboard.

## Milestones

These gates mark real, demonstrable competence. Each one produces something you can show.

| Gate | Milestone | What It Proves |
|------|-----------|----------------|
| **A** | Setup complete + first script + first passing test | You can write and run Python |
| **B** | File/Excel automation handles malformed input gracefully | You can build resilient data tools |
| **C** | SQL ETL pipeline is idempotent and recoverable | You understand data integrity |
| **D** | External API data ingested into local database cache | You can integrate external systems |
| **E** | Browser dashboard renders data for non-technical users | You can build for real users |
