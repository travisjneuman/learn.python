# Try This — Exercise 04

1. Create variables for your own name, age, and favorite color. Print a sentence using all three.

2. Create two number variables and swap their values:
   ```python
   a = 10
   b = 20
   # How do you make a hold 20 and b hold 10?
   # Hint: you might need a third variable as a temporary holder.
   ```

3. Try creating a variable name that starts with a number (like `1name = "test"`). What error do you get? Read the error message — Python is telling you exactly what went wrong.
