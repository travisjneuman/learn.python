# Level 00 — Absolute Beginner
Home: [README](../../README.md)

**Estimated time: ~5 hours**

## Who this is for
You have never written a line of code in your life. You may not know what a "terminal" is. That is completely fine. This level will get you there.

## What you will learn
- How to open Python and type commands
- What variables, numbers, and text (strings) are
- How to make decisions in code (if/else)
- How to repeat things (loops)
- How to organize code (functions)
- How to read a file

## Before you start
1. Complete [00_COMPUTER_LITERACY_PRIMER.md](../../00_COMPUTER_LITERACY_PRIMER.md) if you have never used a terminal.
2. Complete [03_SETUP_ALL_PLATFORMS.md](../../03_SETUP_ALL_PLATFORMS.md) to install Python.
3. Confirm `python --version` works in your terminal.

## Exercises (do them in order)
- [01-first-steps](./01-first-steps/) — Open Python, type `2 + 2`, see the answer
- [02-hello-world](./02-hello-world/) — Your first `print()` statement
- [03-your-first-script](./03-your-first-script/) — Create and run a `.py` file
- [04-variables](./04-variables/) — Store values and use them
- [05-numbers-and-math](./05-numbers-and-math/) — Arithmetic operations
- [06-strings-and-text](./06-strings-and-text/) — Working with text
- [07-user-input](./07-user-input/) — Ask the user for information
- [08-making-decisions](./08-making-decisions/) — `if`, `else`, and comparisons
- [09-lists](./09-lists/) — Collecting multiple items together
- [10-for-loops](./10-for-loops/) — Doing something for each item
- [11-while-loops](./11-while-loops/) — Repeating until a condition is met
- [12-dictionaries](./12-dictionaries/) — Labeled data storage
- [13-functions](./13-functions/) — Reusable blocks of code
- [14-reading-files](./14-reading-files/) — Getting data from files
- [15-putting-it-together](./15-putting-it-together/) — A complete mini-program

## How to work through each exercise
1. **Read** the `.py` file — every line has a comment explaining what it does
2. **Run** it — `python exercise.py` and see what happens
3. **Change** something small and run again
4. **Try** the challenges in `TRY_THIS.md`
5. **Move on** when you can explain what the code does without reading the comments

## Try in your browser (no install needed)

Want to try Python before installing anything? Run these exercises directly in your browser:

[Open Browser Exercises](../../browser/index.html)

Uses [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/) to run real Python in your browser with a code editor and output panel.

## Important
- There are no tests at this level. Just run and observe.
- There is no wrong way to experiment. Break things. That is how you learn.
- If something does not work, read the error message. It usually tells you exactly what went wrong.
- You do not need to memorize anything. You need to understand the pattern.

## When you are done
You are ready for [Level 0](../level-0/README.md) when you can:
- Create a `.py` file from scratch
- Use variables, a loop, and a function in the same script
- Read a simple error message and fix the problem
- Explain what your code does in plain English
