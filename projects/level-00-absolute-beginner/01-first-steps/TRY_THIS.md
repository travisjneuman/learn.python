# Try This — Exercise 01

1. In interactive mode (`python` then `>>>`), try calculating your age in days:
   ```
   your_age * 365
   ```

2. Try dividing numbers that do not divide evenly:
   ```
   7 / 2
   10 / 3
   ```
   Notice Python gives you a decimal answer.

3. Try using `**` for exponents (powers):
   ```
   2 ** 10
   3 ** 3
   ```
   `2 ** 10` means "2 to the power of 10" which is 1024.
