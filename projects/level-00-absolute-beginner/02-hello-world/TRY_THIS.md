# Try This — Exercise 02

1. Change the message inside `print()` to say your own name:
   ```python
   print("Hello, my name is Alice!")
   ```

2. Print three lines that tell a short story:
   ```python
   print("Once upon a time there was a programmer.")
   print("They wrote their first line of code.")
   print("The computer understood them perfectly.")
   ```

3. Try printing a math expression and a word on the same line:
   ```python
   print("I have", 3 + 4, "apples")
   ```
