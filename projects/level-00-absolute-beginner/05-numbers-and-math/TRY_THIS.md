# Try This — Exercise 05

1. Calculate how many seconds are in a year:
   ```python
   seconds_per_minute = 60
   minutes_per_hour = 60
   hours_per_day = 24
   days_per_year = 365
   seconds_per_year = seconds_per_minute * minutes_per_hour * hours_per_day * days_per_year
   print("Seconds in a year:", seconds_per_year)
   ```

2. Use the modulo operator `%` to check if a number is even or odd. Even numbers have a remainder of 0 when divided by 2:
   ```python
   print(10 % 2)  # 0 means even
   print(7 % 2)   # 1 means odd
   ```

3. Try dividing by zero: `print(10 / 0)`. Read the error message carefully. Python refuses to do it and tells you why.
