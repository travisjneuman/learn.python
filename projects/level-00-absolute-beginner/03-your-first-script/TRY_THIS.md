# Try This — Exercise 03

1. Create a brand new file called `my_script.py` in this folder. Put whatever `print()` statements you want in it. Run it with `python my_script.py`.

2. Add a comment (line starting with `#`) to explain what your script does. Run it again — notice the comment has no effect on the output.

3. Try putting a `#` in front of one of the `print()` lines. Run the script. That line will not execute because Python thinks it is a comment now. Remove the `#` to bring it back.
