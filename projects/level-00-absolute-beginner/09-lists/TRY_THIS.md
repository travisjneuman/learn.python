# Try This — Exercise 09

1. Create a list of 5 of your favorite foods. Print it, then add one more and print again.

2. Create a list of numbers. Use `sum()` and `len()` to calculate the average:
   ```python
   grades = [88, 92, 75, 95, 84]
   average = sum(grades) / len(grades)
   print(f"Average grade: {average}")
   ```

3. Try accessing an index that does not exist (like `colors[99]`). Read the error message — it is called an IndexError and tells you the list is not that long.
