# Try This — Exercise 06

1. Create an f-string that introduces yourself with your name, age, and city:
   ```python
   print(f"My name is {name}, I am {age}, and I live in {city}.")
   ```

2. Try putting a quote inside a string. What happens? Fix it:
   ```python
   # This breaks:  print("He said "hello"")
   # Fix option 1: print("He said 'hello'")
   # Fix option 2: print('He said "hello"')
   ```

3. Try multiplying a string by a number:
   ```python
   print("ha" * 3)
   print("-" * 40)
   ```
