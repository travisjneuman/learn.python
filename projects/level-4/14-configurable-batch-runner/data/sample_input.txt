Sample configuration for Configurable Batch Runner
-----------------------------------------------------
This file explains the companion files.

batch_config.json defines the batch processing configuration:
  {
    "batch_size": 5,
    "max_workers": 2,
    "retry_on_failure": true,
    "max_retries": 3,
    "output_format": "json",
    "steps": ["validate", "transform", "load"]
  }

sample_data.txt contains 12 items to process in batches:
  item_001 through item_012

Expected batch execution:
  Batch 1: items 001-005 (5 items)
  Batch 2: items 006-010 (5 items)
  Batch 3: items 011-012 (2 items)

Each batch runs through: validate -> transform -> load
Failed items are retried up to 3 times before being reported as failures.

Expected: 3 batches executed, per-batch timing and status in report
