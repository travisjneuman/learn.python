Sample scenario for Checkpoint Recovery Tool
-----------------------------------------------
This file describes the checkpoint/recovery context.

The project processes a large batch of items and saves checkpoints
so that interrupted runs can resume from where they left off.

Simulated batch of 20 items to process:
  Items 1-8:   already processed (checkpoint file exists)
  Items 9-12:  to be processed this run
  Items 13-20: remaining (will be processed in future runs)

Checkpoint file format (data/checkpoint.json):
  {
    "run_id": "batch-2024-03-15",
    "last_completed": 8,
    "total_items": 20,
    "started_at": "2024-03-15T10:00:00",
    "items_per_second": 2.5
  }

Expected behavior:
  - Resume from item 9 (not item 1)
  - Process items 9-12, update checkpoint
  - If interrupted mid-run, next run picks up where this one stopped
