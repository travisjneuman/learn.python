Sample logs for Audit Log Enhancer
-------------------------------------
This file explains the companion sample_input.jsonl.

sample_input.jsonl contains raw audit events (one JSON object per line):
  Line 1: {"ts":"2024-03-01T09:00:00","user":"alice","action":"login","ip":"10.0.1.5"}
  Line 2: {"ts":"2024-03-01T09:01:30","user":"bob","action":"view_report","ip":"10.0.1.12"}
  Line 3: {"ts":"2024-03-01T09:02:45","user":"alice","action":"export_data","ip":"10.0.1.5"}
  Line 4: {"ts":"2024-03-01T09:05:00","user":"carol","action":"login","ip":"192.168.1.100"}
  Line 5: {"ts":"2024-03-01T09:06:00","user":"bob","action":"delete_record","ip":"10.0.1.12"}
  Line 6: {"ts":"2024-03-01T09:10:00","user":"alice","action":"logout","ip":"10.0.1.5"}

Enhancements applied:
  - Session grouping (group events by user between login/logout)
  - Risk scoring (delete and export actions score higher)
  - IP geolocation tagging (internal vs external network)
  - Duration calculation per session

Expected: 3 users, 2 sessions with duration, 2 high-risk events flagged
