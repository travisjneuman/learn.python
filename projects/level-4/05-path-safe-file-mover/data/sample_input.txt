Sample manifest for Path Safe File Mover
-------------------------------------------
This file describes the test scenario for safe file operations.

The project moves files between directories while enforcing safety:
  - No overwriting existing files without --force
  - No moving outside the designated base directory (path traversal protection)
  - Dry-run mode shows what would happen without making changes
  - Atomic moves using rename when possible, copy+delete when crossing devices

Test files to create for manual testing:
  source/report_q1.csv    -> archive/2024/report_q1.csv
  source/report_q2.csv    -> archive/2024/report_q2.csv
  source/summary.txt      -> archive/2024/summary.txt
  source/../../../etc/passwd -> BLOCKED (path traversal attempt)

Expected: 3 files moved, 1 blocked, move manifest written to log
