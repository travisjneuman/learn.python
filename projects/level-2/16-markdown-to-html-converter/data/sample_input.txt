# Python Quick Reference

This is a **quick reference** for common Python patterns.
Use it as a *cheat sheet* while you learn.

## Variables and Types

Python uses dynamic typing. You do not need to declare types:

- **int** for whole numbers
- **float** for decimals
- **str** for text
- **bool** for True/False

## Example Code

```
name = "Ada"
age = 36
is_scientist = True
print(f"{name} was {age} years old.")
```

## String Methods

Strings have many useful methods:

- *strip()* removes whitespace
- *split()* breaks a string into a list
- *replace()* swaps substrings
- *startswith()* checks a prefix

## Why This Matters

Understanding **string parsing** is the foundation of:

- reading configuration files
- processing log output
- building compilers and interpreters
- converting between data formats

That is the end of this reference.
