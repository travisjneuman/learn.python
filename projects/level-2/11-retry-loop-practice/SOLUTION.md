# Solution: Level 2 / Project 11 - Retry Loop Practice

> **STOP** — Have you attempted this project yourself first?
>
> Learning happens in the struggle, not in reading answers.
> Spend at least 20 minutes trying before reading this solution.
> If you are stuck, try the [Walkthrough](./WALKTHROUGH.md) first — it guides
> your thinking without giving away the answer.

## Design decisions

| Decision | Why | Alternative considered |
|----------|-----|----------------------|
| retry function | [reason] | [alternative] |
| retry_no_sleep function | [reason] | [alternative] |
| make_flaky_function function | [reason] | [alternative] |

## Alternative approaches

### Approach B: [Name]

```python
# [Different valid approach with trade-offs explained]
```

**Trade-off:** [When you would prefer this approach vs the primary one]

## What could go wrong

| Scenario | What happens | Prevention |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| [bad input] | [error/behavior] | [how to handle] |
| [edge case] | [behavior] | [how to handle] |
