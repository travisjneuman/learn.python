Sample data for Level 5 Mini Capstone
----------------------------------------
This file explains the capstone pipeline scenario.

The capstone combines Level 5 skills into a full operational pipeline:
  - Config loading with layer priority (project 04)
  - Multi-file ETL extraction (project 03)
  - Plugin-style transforms (project 05)
  - Metrics aggregation (project 06)
  - Resilient loading with fallbacks (project 07)
  - Retry with backoff on failures (project 11)
  - Atomic export (project 12)
  - Run logging (project 13)

Pipeline configuration (data/pipeline_config.json):
  Sources: data/sources/ directory containing CSV files
  Transforms: normalize, deduplicate, validate
  Output: data/pipeline_output.json
  Retry: max 3 attempts with 0.5s base delay

Expected: full pipeline execution with run log, metrics summary,
and atomic output. Any failures trigger retry with backoff.
