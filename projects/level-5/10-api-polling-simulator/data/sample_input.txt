Sample scenario for API Polling Simulator
--------------------------------------------
This file describes the polling simulation.

The project simulates polling a REST API with rate limiting:
  - MockAPI returns success, error, or rate-limit responses randomly
  - Poller retries on failure with exponential backoff
  - Rate-limited responses trigger longer delays
  - Results are collected and summarized

Simulated API behavior (configurable):
  Success rate:     70%  (returns {"status": "ok", "data": {...}})
  Error rate:       10%  (returns {"status": "error", "message": "..."})
  Rate-limit rate:  20%  (returns {"status": "rate_limited", "retry_after": N})

Polling configuration:
  max_polls: 10
  base_delay: 0.1 seconds
  backoff_factor: 2 (doubles delay after each rate-limit)
  max_backoff: 5.0 seconds

Expected: ~7 successful polls, ~2 rate-limited, ~1 error
Poll results written to data/poll_results.json
