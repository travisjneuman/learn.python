Sample data for Change Detection Tool
----------------------------------------
This file explains the companion old_version.txt and new_version.txt.

old_version.txt (baseline configuration):
  server_name = production-web-01
  max_connections = 100
  timeout_seconds = 30
  log_level = INFO
  cache_enabled = true
  worker_threads = 4

new_version.txt (current configuration):
  server_name = production-web-01
  max_connections = 200         (changed: 100 -> 200)
  timeout_seconds = 30
  log_level = DEBUG             (changed: INFO -> DEBUG)
  cache_enabled = true
  worker_threads = 8            (changed: 4 -> 8)
  ssl_enabled = true            (added: new line)

Change detection results:
  Status: modified
  Lines added: 1 (ssl_enabled)
  Lines removed: 0
  Lines changed: 3 (max_connections, log_level, worker_threads)
  SHA-256 hashes differ: yes
