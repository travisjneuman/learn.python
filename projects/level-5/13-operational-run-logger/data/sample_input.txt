Sample input for Operational Run Logger
------------------------------------------
This file contains lines to process during a logged run.

Each line represents a task item to process:
  validate user records
  sync inventory database
  generate sales report
  send notification emails
  archive old transactions
  update dashboard metrics
  check SSL certificate expiry
  rotate application logs
  rebuild search index

The run logger tracks each step:
  - run_id: unique identifier for this execution
  - Events: start, item_processed, item_failed, finish
  - Timing: start_time, end_time, duration_ms per item
  - Summary: total items, successes, failures, overall status

Expected: 9 items processed, run log with lifecycle events written to JSON
