Sample data for Multi-File ETL Runner
----------------------------------------
This file explains the ETL source files.

The project extracts data from multiple source files, transforms it,
and loads the combined result into a single output.

Source directory (data/sources/) contains:
  sales_east.csv   — regional sales from East division
  sales_west.csv   — regional sales from West division
  sales_north.csv  — regional sales from North division

Each CSV has columns: date,product,quantity,revenue,region

ETL steps:
  1. Extract: read all CSV files from source directory
  2. Transform: normalize column names, convert types, add source_file column
  3. Load: merge into single output with deduplication

Expected: 3 files extracted, rows merged, duplicates removed,
combined output written to data/etl_output.json
