Sample task list for Schedule Ready Script
---------------------------------------------
This file describes the scheduling scenario.

The project runs tasks on a schedule without user interaction:
  - Reads a task configuration with cron-like schedule expressions
  - Determines which tasks are due based on current time
  - Executes due tasks and logs results
  - Handles lock files to prevent duplicate runs

Sample task schedule:
  task: daily_report    schedule: "0 8 * * *"    (every day at 8:00 AM)
  task: weekly_cleanup  schedule: "0 2 * * 0"    (Sundays at 2:00 AM)
  task: hourly_check    schedule: "0 * * * *"    (every hour on the hour)
  task: monthly_archive schedule: "0 0 1 * *"    (1st of each month at midnight)

Expected: tasks evaluated against current time, due tasks executed,
lock file created to prevent overlapping runs, results logged to JSON
