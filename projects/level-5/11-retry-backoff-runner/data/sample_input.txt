Sample scenario for Retry Backoff Runner
-------------------------------------------
This file describes the retry with backoff scenario.

The project wraps a flaky function with exponential backoff retry logic:
  - A simulated function fails N times before succeeding
  - Each retry doubles the wait time (exponential backoff)
  - A jitter option adds randomness to prevent thundering herd
  - All attempts are logged with timing information

Configuration:
  max_retries: 5
  base_delay: 0.1 seconds
  backoff_factor: 2.0
  jitter: false (can be enabled)

Simulated flaky function:
  Attempt 1: raises ConnectionError("timeout")
  Attempt 2: raises ConnectionError("timeout")
  Attempt 3: returns {"status": "ok", "value": 42}  (success!)

Retry timeline:
  Attempt 1 -> fail -> wait 0.1s
  Attempt 2 -> fail -> wait 0.2s
  Attempt 3 -> success (total delay: 0.3s)

Expected: success after 3 attempts, total delay 0.3s logged in report
