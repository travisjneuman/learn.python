# Capstone Projects

[Home](../../README.md)

## Overview

Capstone projects are open-ended challenges where you define the architecture and implementation yourself. Unlike the structured projects in levels 0-10, these briefs give you a problem domain and requirements but leave the design decisions to you.

## Prerequisites

Complete **Level 5** or higher before attempting these capstones. You should be comfortable with:

- Application architecture and module organization
- File I/O and data persistence
- Testing strategies (unit tests at minimum)
- Error handling and logging
- Virtual environments and dependency management

## Capstones

| # | Project | Domain | Complexity |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 01 | [Personal Finance Tracker](./01_personal_finance_tracker/) | Data management, CLI, reporting | Medium |
| 02 | [API Aggregator](./02_api_aggregator/) | HTTP clients, caching, data normalization | Medium-High |
| 03 | [Task Automation System](./03_task_automation_system/) | File watching, plugins, configuration | High |

## How Capstones Work

1. Read the project brief in the capstone's `README.md`.
2. Fill out the design prompts in `notes.md` before writing any code.
3. Design your architecture. Consider writing an `ARCHITECTURE.md` document.
4. Implement the solution. There is no starter code — you build from scratch.
5. Write tests. Aim for meaningful coverage of your core logic.
6. Write a retrospective in `notes.md` reflecting on your design decisions.

## What Makes Capstones Different

In the level projects, the README tells you exactly what to build and often how. Capstones give you the "what" but leave the "how" entirely to you. There is no single correct answer. Two learners can build the same capstone with completely different architectures and both be right.

The design prompts in `notes.md` are there to help you think through decisions before coding. Fill them out honestly — they are for your benefit, not for grading.

## Evaluation

Use the Capstone Submission Template in `curriculum/50_CERTIFICATION_GRADE_COMPLETION_PROTOCOL.md` to prepare your submission. Capstones are evaluated on design quality and tradeoff reasoning, not just correctness.
