> Learning happens in the struggle, not in reading answers.
> Spend at least 20 minutes trying before reading this solution.
> If you are stuck, try first — it guides

## Complete solution

```python
# WHY test_successful_request: [explain the design reason]
# WHY test_404_not_found: [explain the design reason]
# WHY test_connection_error: [explain the design reason]
# WHY test_timeout: [explain the design reason]
# WHY fetch_with_retry: [explain the design reason]
# WHY test_retry: [explain the design reason]

# [paste the complete working solution here]
# Include WHY comments on every non-obvious line.
```

## Design decisions

| Decision | Why | Alternative considered |
|----------|-----|----------------------|
| test_successful_request function | [reason] | [alternative] |
| test_404_not_found function | [reason] | [alternative] |
| test_connection_error function | [reason] | [alternative] |

## Alternative approaches

### Approach B: [Name]

```python
# [Different valid approach with trade-offs explained]
```

**Trade-off:** [When you would prefer this approach vs the primary one]

## What could go wrong

| Scenario | What happens | Prevention |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| [bad input] | [error/behavior] | [how to handle] |
| [edge case] | [behavior] | [how to handle] |
