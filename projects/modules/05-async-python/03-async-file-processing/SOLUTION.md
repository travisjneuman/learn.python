## Complete solution

```python
# WHY generate_sample_files: [explain the design reason]
# WHY process_file_sync: [explain the design reason]
# WHY run_sync: [explain the design reason]

# [paste the complete working solution here]
# Include WHY comments on every non-obvious line.
```

## Design decisions

| Decision | Why | Alternative considered |
|----------|-----|----------------------|
| generate_sample_files function | [reason] | [alternative] |
| process_file_sync function | [reason] | [alternative] |
| run_sync function | [reason] | [alternative] |

## Alternative approaches

### Approach B: [Name]

```python
# [Different valid approach with trade-offs explained]
```

**Trade-off:** [When you would prefer this approach vs the primary one]

## What could go wrong

| Scenario | What happens | Prevention |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| [bad input] | [error/behavior] | [how to handle] |
| [edge case] | [behavior] | [how to handle] |
