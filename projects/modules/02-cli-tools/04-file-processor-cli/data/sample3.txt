Virtual environments isolate project dependencies from each other.
Without them, installing a package for one project might break another.
The venv module is built into Python 3 and creates lightweight environments.
Each environment has its own site-packages directory where pip installs packages.
Activating an environment adjusts your PATH so the right python binary runs.
You should create a new virtual environment for every project you work on.
This is one of the first habits every Python developer should build.
Requirements files list the packages a project needs so anyone can recreate the environment.
