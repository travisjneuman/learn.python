The command line is one of the oldest interfaces to computers.
Before graphical user interfaces existed, every interaction
happened through typed commands and printed text.
Modern CLI tools bring that efficiency back with better design.
Libraries like Click and Typer make it easy to build
professional command-line applications in Python.
