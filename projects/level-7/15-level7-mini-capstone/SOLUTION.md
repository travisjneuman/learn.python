## Design decisions

| Decision | Why | Alternative considered |
|----------|-----|----------------------|
| adapt_source function | [reason] | [alternative] |
| validate_contract function | [reason] | [alternative] |
| check_freshness function | [reason] | [alternative] |

## Alternative approaches
