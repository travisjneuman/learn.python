# Solution: Level 8 / Project 15 - Level 8 Mini Capstone

> **STOP** — Have you attempted this project yourself first?

> Learning happens in the struggle, not in reading answers.
> Spend at least 20 minutes trying before reading this solution.
> If you are stuck, try the [Walkthrough](./WALKTHROUGH.md) first — it guides

## Design decisions

| Decision | Why | Alternative considered |
|----------|-----|----------------------|
| _percentile function | [reason] | [alternative] |
| run_simulation function | [reason] | [alternative] |
| parse_args function | [reason] | [alternative] |

## Alternative approaches

### Approach B: [Name]

```python
# [Different valid approach with trade-offs explained]
```

**Trade-off:** [When you would prefer this approach vs the primary one]

## What could go wrong

| Scenario | What happens | Prevention |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| [bad input] | [error/behavior] | [how to handle] |
| [edge case] | [behavior] | [how to handle] |
