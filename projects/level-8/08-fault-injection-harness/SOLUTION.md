## Design decisions

| Decision | Why | Alternative considered |
|----------|-----|----------------------|
| corrupt_data function | [reason] | [alternative] |
| run_demo function | [reason] | [alternative] |
| parse_args function | [reason] | [alternative] |

## Alternative approaches

### Approach B: [Name]
