# Elite Track Projects (World-Class Full-Stack Engineering)
Home: [README](../../README.md)

This track extends the level-0 to level-10 ladder with advanced, systems-focused projects.

## Who should run this
- Learners who completed the core ladder and capstones.
- Engineers targeting top-tier architecture and production judgment.

## Projects
- [01-algorithms-complexity-lab](./01-algorithms-complexity-lab/README.md) - complexity evidence and tradeoffs
- [02-concurrent-job-system](./02-concurrent-job-system/README.md) - concurrency, retries, failure boundaries
- [03-distributed-cache-simulator](./03-distributed-cache-simulator/README.md) - cache correctness and consistency
- [04-secure-auth-gateway](./04-secure-auth-gateway/README.md) - token policy and safe auth failures
- [05-performance-profiler-workbench](./05-performance-profiler-workbench/README.md) - benchmark and bottleneck analysis
- [06-event-driven-architecture-lab](./06-event-driven-architecture-lab/README.md) - event contracts and replay safety
- [07-observability-slo-platform](./07-observability-slo-platform/README.md) - SLI/SLO reliability reporting
- [08-policy-compliance-engine](./08-policy-compliance-engine/README.md) - policy checks and audit evidence
- [09-open-source-maintainer-simulator](./09-open-source-maintainer-simulator/README.md) - maintainer workflow simulation
- [10-staff-engineer-capstone](./10-staff-engineer-capstone/README.md) - integrated elite systems capstone

## Execution order
1. Run projects 01 through 10 in order.
2. For each project: alter, break, fix, explain.
3. Capture one ADR and one postmortem note per project.

## Validation commands
- `./run_elite_smoke_checks.sh`
- `./run_elite_smoke_checks.sh --full`

## Next
Return to [projects index](../README.md).
