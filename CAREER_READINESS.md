# Career Readiness — Mapping Curriculum Levels to Job Roles

Home: [README](./README.md)

This document maps your progress through the learn.python curriculum to real-world job roles, interview topics, and employer expectations.

## Level-to-Role Mapping

| Curriculum Level | Equivalent Role | Typical Title |
|------------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Level 0–2 | Pre-employable | Student, Self-taught beginner |
| Level 3 | Intern-ready | Software Engineering Intern |
| Level 5 | Junior-ready | Junior Python Developer, Junior Backend Developer |
| Level 7 | Mid-level ready | Python Developer, Backend Engineer |
| Level 9 | Senior-adjacent | Senior Python Developer, Staff Engineer track |
| Level 10 + Elite | Senior-ready | Senior Engineer, Technical Lead |

These are guidelines, not hard rules. Employers vary. Some junior roles expect Level 2 skills; some expect Level 5. The mapping reflects typical market expectations.

## Interview Prep by Level

### Level 3 — Intern Interviews

**Topics to review:**

- Variables, types, and type conversion
- Loops (for, while) and when to use each
- Functions: parameters, return values, scope
- Lists, dicts, sets, tuples — when to use each
- File I/O basics
- String methods and formatting

**Common interview questions:**

1. Reverse a string
2. Find the most frequent element in a list
3. Check if a string is a palindrome
4. Merge two sorted lists
5. FizzBuzz (yes, still)

**Practice:** The beginner coding challenges in `practice/challenges/beginner/` cover all of these.

### Level 5 — Junior Interviews

**Topics to review:**

Everything from Level 3, plus:

- Classes and OOP basics
- Error handling with try/except
- List comprehensions and generator expressions
- Decorators (what they do, when to use them)
- Package structure and imports
- Testing with pytest
- Git workflow (branching, merging, resolving conflicts)

**Common interview questions:**

1. Design a simple class hierarchy (e.g., Shape → Circle, Rectangle)
2. Write a function with proper error handling
3. Parse and transform a JSON API response
4. Write tests for a given function (including edge cases)
5. Explain what a decorator does and write a simple one

**Practice:** The intermediate coding challenges in `practice/challenges/intermediate/` target this level.

### Level 7 — Mid-Level Interviews

**Topics to review:**

Everything from Level 5, plus:

- Database design (normalization, indexing, queries)
- API design (REST principles, status codes, authentication)
- Concurrency (async/await, threading basics)
- Design patterns (strategy, observer, factory — practical applications)
- System design basics (caching, load balancing, queues)
- Performance profiling and optimization

**Common interview questions:**

1. Design a URL shortener (system design)
2. Implement a rate limiter
3. Design a caching layer with TTL
4. Write an ETL pipeline for a given data source
5. Debug a performance issue in a given code sample

### Level 9+ — Senior Interviews

**Topics to review:**

Everything from Level 7, plus:

- Distributed systems concepts
- CAP theorem and its practical implications
- Event-driven architecture
- Security (OWASP top 10, authentication/authorization)
- Observability (metrics, logs, traces)
- Capacity planning and cost modeling
- Technical leadership and decision-making

**Common interview questions:**

1. Design a system that processes 1M events per day
2. How would you migrate a monolith to microservices?
3. Walk through an incident you resolved and what you changed afterward
4. How do you decide between building and buying?
5. How do you evaluate technical debt and decide when to address it?

## What Employers Actually Look For

### At Every Level

1. **Can you solve problems?** — Not memorize solutions, but think through new problems
2. **Can you communicate?** — Explain your reasoning, ask clarifying questions
3. **Can you learn?** — Show evidence of growth over time
4. **Do you test your code?** — This alone puts you ahead of most candidates

### The Uncomfortable Truth

- Your portfolio matters more than your resume for your first role
- Open-source contributions are noticed but not required
- Networking (meetups, communities, Twitter/LinkedIn) opens more doors than applications
- The best way to prepare for interviews is to build things and explain them

2. Build a project outside the curriculum that solves a real problem
3. Write about what you learned (blog posts, dev.to, LinkedIn)
4. Take on more responsibility at work (code reviews, mentoring)
5. Study system design

### Senior Track (Mid → Senior)

1. Complete through Level 10 + Elite track
2. Lead a project or technical initiative at work
3. Present at meetups or conferences
4. Contribute significantly to open-source
5. Develop a specialty (data engineering, platform, ML ops, etc.)

## Salary Expectations (General Guidance)

Salaries vary enormously by location, company size, and industry. These are rough US market ranges as of 2025–2026:

| Role | US Range (Annual) |
|------|-------------------|
| Intern | $20–40/hr (or stipend) |
| Junior | $60,000–$90,000 |
| Mid-Level | $90,000–$140,000 |
| Senior | $140,000–$200,000+ |

Remote roles, FAANG companies, and high cost-of-living areas shift these ranges significantly. Do your own research on levels.fyi, Glassdoor, and Blind.
