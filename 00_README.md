# Python SME Plan (Automation + Dashboards + Excel/SQL/SolarWinds)

Generated: **Monday, February 16, 2026, 2:11 PM (America/Detroit)**

This folder is a **self-contained learning program** that starts at **zero experience** and takes you to **Python Subject Matter Expert (SME)** for:
- **Automation scripting** (files, ETL, scheduled jobs)
- **Reporting** (Excel + SQL + SolarWinds)
- **Web GUIs / dashboards** (internal tools people can use)

All links are **relative**. Keep these files together in the same folder and the links will work anywhere.

## Start here (in order)
1. **[01_ROADMAP.md](./01_ROADMAP.md)** — the full program (phases, timelines, deliverables)
2. **[03_SETUP_WINDOWS11.md](./03_SETUP_WINDOWS11.md)** — step-by-step setup from scratch
3. **[02_GLOSSARY.md](./02_GLOSSARY.md)** — terms (CI/CD, PyPI, venv, pip, etc.)
4. Work through the phase docs as referenced in the roadmap.
