# Debugging Methodology

Debugging is the systematic process of finding and fixing bugs. It is not about staring at code until you see the problem — it is a repeatable method that works on any bug, in any language. The best debuggers are not the smartest programmers; they are the most methodical.

This concept is covered in two parts:

1. **[Part 1: Approach and Mental Models](./debugging-methodology-part1.md)** — The 7-step method (Reproduce, Isolate, Hypothesize, Test, Fix, Verify, Prevent) and strategies by error type
2. **[Part 2: Tools and Techniques](./debugging-methodology-part2.md)** — print debugging, `breakpoint()`/`pdb`, `icecream`, `snoop`, and common mistakes

## Practice

- [Level 0 projects](../projects/level-0/) — practice debugging failing tests
- [Module 08 Advanced Testing](../projects/modules/08-testing-advanced/) — systematic testing catches bugs early
- [Errors and Debugging](./errors-and-debugging.md) — understanding Python errors
- [Reading Error Messages](./reading-error-messages.md) — traceback anatomy
