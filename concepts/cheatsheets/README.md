# Python Beginner Cheat Sheets

Quick-reference sheets for the core beginner concepts. Each one fits on roughly one printed page and covers the syntax, patterns, and pitfalls you will hit most often.

## Cheat Sheets

| Concept | What it covers |
|---------|---------------|
| [Variables](variables.md) | Creating, naming, updating, and embedding variables in strings |
| [Strings](strings.md) | Text operations -- slicing, methods, f-strings, formatting |
| [Types and Conversions](types-and-conversions.md) | `str`, `int`, `float`, `bool`, converting between them, truthy/falsy |
| [Loops](loops.md) | `for` loops, `while` loops, `range()`, `break`, `continue` |
| [Functions](functions.md) | Defining, calling, parameters, defaults, return values |
| [Collections](collections.md) | Lists, dicts, sets, tuples -- when to use each |
| [Files and Paths](files-and-paths.md) | Reading, writing, file modes, `pathlib` |
| [Errors and Debugging](errors-and-debugging.md) | Reading tracebacks, common error types, `try/except`, print debugging |

## How to Use These

**While coding:** Keep the relevant sheet open in another tab. Glance at it when you forget a method name or syntax detail.

**Before a project:** Skim the sheet for the concepts the project uses. It takes 30 seconds and saves 30 minutes of searching.

**After a mistake:** Check the "Common Mistakes" table. Your bug is probably listed there.
