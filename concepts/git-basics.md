# Git Basics

Git is a version control system — it tracks every change you make to your code, lets you undo mistakes, and makes it possible for multiple people to work on the same project without overwriting each other's work. Every professional developer uses git daily.

This concept is covered in two parts:

1. **[Part 1: Local Git](./git-basics-part1.md)** — init, add, commit, branch, merge, `.gitignore`, and undoing things
2. **[Part 2: Remote Git and GitHub](./git-basics-part2.md)** — push, pull, clone, the GitHub workflow, and resolving merge conflicts

## Practice

- Every project in this curriculum uses git — practice with each one
- [Level 0 projects](../projects/level-0/) — start committing your work
- [Module 09 Docker Deployment](../projects/modules/09-docker-deployment/) — git + CI/CD
