## Best Single Video

**[Positional-only and keyword-only arguments in Python](https://youtube.com/watch?v=R8-oAqCgHag)** by mCoding (10 min)
Why: Goes beyond the basics of *args and **kwargs to explain the / and * separators in function signatures, which control how arguments can be passed. Precise, well-structured, and fills the gap that most tutorials miss.

## Alternatives

- **[Python Tutorial for Beginners 8: Functions](https://youtube.com/watch?v=9Os0o3wzS_I)** by Corey Schafer (21 min) — Covers *args and **kwargs as part of a broader functions tutorial, showing how they fit into Python's argument-passing system. Start here if you are still getting comfortable with functions.
- **[Python 101: Learn These MUST KNOW List Features](https://youtube.com/watch?v=s46yyTKvl-I)** by Tech With Tim (15 min) — Covers unpacking and the * operator in the context of lists, which builds the mental model needed to understand *args in function calls.

## Deep Dives

- **[5 Tips For Object-Oriented Programming Done Well - In Python](https://youtube.com/watch?v=-ghD-XjjO2g)** by ArjanCodes (22 min) — Demonstrates how *args and **kwargs are used in real class hierarchies and design patterns, showing when variable-length arguments genuinely improve your code versus when they hide poor design.
