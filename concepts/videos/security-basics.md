# Security Basics — Video Resources

[← Back to Concept](../security-basics.md)

## Best Single Video

**[Python Tutorial: Securely Manage Passwords and API Keys with DotEnv](https://youtube.com/watch?v=PYuTzLswn_Y)** by Corey Schafer (~10 min)
Why: The single most common security mistake beginners make is hardcoding secrets in source code. This video covers environment variables, .env files, python-dotenv, and gitignore patterns to keep credentials out of your repository. Short, practical, and immediately applicable to every Python project.

## Alternatives

- **[Cryptography for Beginners: Full Python Course (SHA-256, AES, RSA, Passwords)](https://youtube.com/watch?v=j6vNTilCEZo)** by freeCodeCamp / Thanishkka (~1 hr) — A hands-on course building a command-line cryptography tool in Python. Covers hashing with SHA-256, symmetric encryption with AES, asymmetric encryption with RSA, and secure password handling. Teaches the theory alongside working code.
- **[Python Tutorial: AsyncIO - Complete Guide to Asynchronous Programming](https://youtube.com/watch?v=oAkLSJNr5zY)** by Corey Schafer (~90 min) — The sections on error handling and safe task cancellation teach defensive programming patterns that are fundamental to security. Understanding how to handle exceptions properly prevents information leakage and denial-of-service vulnerabilities.

## Deep Dives

- **[Python API Development - Comprehensive Course for Beginners](https://youtube.com/watch?v=0sOvCWFmrtA)** by freeCodeCamp / Sanjeev Thiyagarajan (~19 hrs) — Includes substantial sections on password hashing with bcrypt, JWT authentication, input validation with Pydantic, SQL injection prevention with SQLAlchemy, and environment-based configuration. The authentication and authorization chapters (around hours 5-8) are a practical security masterclass.
- **[Python Tutorial: Unit Testing Your Code with the unittest Module](https://youtube.com/watch?v=6tNS--WetLI)** by Corey Schafer (~39 min) — Testing is a security practice. This video teaches you to write tests that verify your validation logic, authentication flows, and error handling work correctly, catching security regressions before they reach production.
