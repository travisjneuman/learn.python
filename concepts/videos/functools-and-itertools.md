# functools and itertools — Video Resources

[← Back to Concept](../functools-and-itertools.md)

## Best Single Video

**[Python Tutorial: Decorators - Dynamically Alter The Functionality Of Your Functions](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FsAPt_9Bf3U)** by Corey Schafer (30 min)
Why: functools.wraps is the most important functools tool for intermediate developers, and this video teaches it in context. Starts from closures, builds to decorators, and shows functools.wraps in action. Understanding this pattern unlocks the rest of functools.

## Alternatives

- **[The Single Most Useful Decorator in Python](https://youtube.com/watch?v=DnKxKFXB4NQ)** by mCoding (8 min) — A focused deep dive on functools.wraps specifically: why every decorator should use it, what breaks without it, and the subtle metadata issues it solves. Short and immediately actionable.
- **[Iterators, Iterables, and Itertools](https://youtube.com/watch?v=WR7mO_jYN9g)** by Socratica (~12 min) — Covers the itertools module alongside the iterator protocol. Shows chain, islice, count, cycle, and other itertools functions with clean examples. A solid itertools primer.

## Deep Dives

- **[Python Tutorial: Generators - How to Use Them and the Benefits You Receive](https://youtube.com/watch?v=bD05uGo_sVI)** by Corey Schafer (~11 min) — Generators are the foundation that itertools builds on. Understanding yield and lazy evaluation is prerequisite knowledge for using itertools effectively. This video provides that foundation.
- **[Python Decorators: The Complete Guide](https://youtube.com/watch?v=QH5fw9kxDQA)** by ArjanCodes (22 min) — Covers both functional and class-based decorators with a software design lens. The sections on functools.wraps and decorators with arguments show functools patterns in a broader architectural context.
