## Best Single Video

**[Python Tutorial: Calling External Commands Using the Subprocess Module](https://youtube.com/watch?v=2Fp1N6dof0Y)** by Corey Schafer (~19 min)
Why: Bridges the gap between knowing terminal commands and controlling them from Python. Covers subprocess.run, capturing output, handling errors, piping commands, and shell=True safety considerations. The essential video for Python developers who want to automate terminal workflows.

## Alternatives

- **[Python Tutorial: Pathlib - The Modern Way to Handle File Paths](https://youtube.com/watch?v=yxa-DJuuTBI)** by Corey Schafer (~30 min) — File path manipulation is one of the most common terminal-adjacent tasks in Python.

- **[Python Tutorial: Zip Files - Creating and Extracting Archives](https://youtube.com/watch?v=z0gguhEmWiY)** by Corey Schafer (~10 min) — Covers Python's zipfile module for creating and extracting archives programmatically. A practical terminal skill translated into Python.

## Deep Dives

- **[Python Threading Tutorial](https://youtube.com/watch?v=IEEhzQoKtQU)** by Corey Schafer (~16 min) — When terminal commands take a long time, threading lets you run multiple in parallel. This video explains threading with examples that include running external processes concurrently.
- **[Python Tutorial: Securely Manage Passwords and API Keys with DotEnv](https://youtube.com/watch?v=PYuTzLswn_Y)** by Corey Schafer (~10 min) — Environment variables are fundamental to terminal-based workflows. This video covers .env files, the python-dotenv package, and secure secrets management, skills every developer needs when working at the command line.
