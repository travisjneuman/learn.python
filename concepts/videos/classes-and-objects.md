## Best Single Video

**[Python OOP Tutorial 1: Classes and Instances](https://youtube.com/watch?v=ZDa-Z5JzLYM)** by Corey Schafer (15 min)
Why: The gold standard introduction to Python classes. Corey builds an Employee class step by step, explaining __init__, instance variables, and methods with clear live coding. First in a 6-part OOP series that builds naturally.

## Alternatives

- **[Python OOP Tutorial 2: Class Variables](https://youtube.com/watch?v=BJ-VvGyQxho)** by Corey Schafer (12 min) — Natural follow-up covering the difference between class and instance variables, a concept that trips up many learners.
- **[Python Object Oriented Programming (OOP) - For Beginners](https://youtube.com/watch?v=JeznW_7DlB0)** by Tech With Tim (53 min) — A single comprehensive video covering classes, inheritance, and OOP principles. Good if you prefer one longer session over a series.
- **[Functions vs Classes: When to Use Which and Why?](https://youtube.com/watch?v=txRTzljmV0Q)** by ArjanCodes (18 min) — Addresses the practical question of when you actually need a class versus using functions. Valuable for developing design intuition.
