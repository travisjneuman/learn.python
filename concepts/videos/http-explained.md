## Best Single Video

**[Python Tutorial: AsyncIO - Complete Guide to Asynchronous Programming](https://youtube.com/watch?v=oAkLSJNr5zY)** by Corey Schafer (~90 min)
Why: While titled AsyncIO, this video begins with an excellent breakdown of how HTTP requests work, the request-response cycle, and why async matters for web communication. Corey uses animations to show what happens when your Python code talks to a server. The HTTP fundamentals section in the first 20 minutes is one of the clearest explanations available.
