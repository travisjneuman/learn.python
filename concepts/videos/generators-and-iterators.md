# Generators and Iterators — Video Resources

## Best Single Video

**[Python Tutorial: Generators - How to Use Them and the Benefits You Receive](https://youtube.com/watch?v=bD05uGo_sVI)** by Corey Schafer (~11 min)
Why: Builds generators from the ground up, starting with a normal function and converting it to a generator with yield. Demonstrates memory savings with concrete before-and-after measurements. Clear, concise, and immediately practical. The go-to starting point for understanding generators.

## Alternatives

- **[Generators](https://youtube.com/watch?v=gMompY5MyPg)** by Socratica (~9 min) — A polished, classroom-style explanation of generators with a focus on the conceptual "why." Socratica's production quality makes this feel like a lecture, which some learners prefer.
- **[Iterators, Iterables, and Itertools](https://youtube.com/watch?v=WR7mO_jYN9g)** by Socratica (~12 min) — Covers the iterator protocol (__iter__ and __next__), what makes something iterable versus an iterator, and introduces the itertools module. A different angle that focuses on the protocol underneath generators.

## Deep Dives

- **[Python Tutorial: Decorators - Dynamically Alter The Functionality Of Your Functions](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FsAPt_9Bf3U)** by Corey Schafer (30 min) — Understanding closures (covered in the first half) is essential for grasping how generators maintain state between yields. This video fills in the mental model that makes generators click.
