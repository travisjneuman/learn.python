## Best single video

- **CS50P - Lecture 3: Exceptions** by Harvard / David Malan (~2 hrs full lecture)
  David Malan spends significant time showing students how to read Python error messages, tracing from the traceback line to the actual bug. The first 30 minutes are especially focused on understanding what Python is telling you when something goes wrong. One of the best treatments of this topic available.

## Alternative explanations

- **Exceptions in Python** by Socratica (~5 min)
  Socratica demonstrates common Python exceptions (TypeError, ValueError, KeyError) and shows what each error message means. The short runtime makes it easy to rewatch when you encounter a new error type.

- **Python Tutorial for Beginners - Full Course** by Mosh Hamedani (~6 hrs full course)
  Mosh covers exceptions and error messages in his full course, explaining the anatomy of a traceback and common error types. His calm, visual teaching style makes error messages feel less intimidating. Jump to the exceptions chapter.

## Deep dives

- **Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners** by freeCodeCamp (~4.5 hrs)
  The freeCodeCamp course encounters errors naturally throughout its projects, and the instructor explains each traceback as it appears. Seeing error messages in context -- rather than in isolation -- helps build the habit of reading them carefully.
