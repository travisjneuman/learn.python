## Best Single Video

**[Python Tutorial for Beginners 9: Import Modules and Exploring The Standard Library](https://youtube.com/watch?v=CqvZ3vGoGs0)** by Corey Schafer (22 min)
Why: Corey walks through importing your own modules, importing from the standard library, and explains sys.path and how Python finds modules. Methodical, beginner-friendly, and covers the full import workflow from scratch.

## Alternatives

- **[Avoiding Import Loops in Python](https://youtube.com/watch?v=UnKa_t-M_kM)** by mCoding (11 min) — Tackles circular imports, a common stumbling block once you start splitting code into multiple files. More intermediate but essential knowledge.
- **[You should put this in all your Python scripts | if __name__ == '__main__'](https://youtube.com/watch?v=g_wlZ9IhbTs)** by mCoding (9 min) — Explains the __name__ guard that controls what runs when a file is imported vs executed directly. Short and practical.

## Deep Dives

- **[Python Tutorial: Closures - How to Use Them and Why They Are Useful](https://youtube.com/watch?v=swU3c34d2NQ)** by Corey Schafer (12 min) — While focused on closures, this video demonstrates how Python's module system interacts with scoping and how imports affect variable lookup.
