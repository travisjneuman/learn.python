## Best Single Video

**[Python Testing with pytest (Full Course)]** by ArjanCodes (~40 min)
`https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=arjancodes+python+testing+pytest+full`

*Why this one:* Goes beyond basic assertions into parametrize, fixtures, mocking, conftest patterns, and test architecture — with a focus on writing tests that actually catch bugs rather than just increasing coverage numbers.
