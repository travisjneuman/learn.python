# Collections Deep Dive — Video Resources

[← Back to Concept](../collections-deep-dive.md)

## Best Single Video

**[Iterators, Iterables, and Itertools](https://youtube.com/watch?v=WR7mO_jYN9g)** by Socratica (~12 min)
Why: Socratica covers the collections-adjacent territory of itertools alongside the iterator protocol, showing how Python's data-handling tools connect. High production quality and a methodical pace that helps the concepts sink in. A strong companion to studying the collections module.

## Alternatives

- **[Python Tutorial: Generators - How to Use Them and the Benefits You Receive](https://youtube.com/watch?v=bD05uGo_sVI)** by Corey Schafer (~11 min) — Generators are the gateway to understanding lazy evaluation, which is the design philosophy behind many collections module tools like deque and defaultdict. Covers yield, memory efficiency, and generator expressions.
- **[Python Tutorial: AsyncIO - Complete Guide to Asynchronous Programming](https://youtube.com/watch?v=oAkLSJNr5zY)** by Corey Schafer (~90 min) — The section on data structures for concurrent programming covers how deque is used as a thread-safe collection and how OrderedDict behavior evolved in modern Python. Watch the data structures section for collections context.

## Deep Dives

- **[Special Methods](https://youtube.com/watch?v=IkWrlRei0uA)** by Socratica (~10 min) — Understanding dunder methods (__getitem__, __len__, __contains__) is essential for knowing how collections types like defaultdict and Counter work under the hood. This video explains the protocol that makes Python collections composable.
