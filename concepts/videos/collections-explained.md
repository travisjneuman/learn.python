## Best single video

- **Python Lists** by Socratica (~6 min)
  A clear, focused introduction to Python's most-used collection type. Socratica covers creating lists, indexing, slicing, appending, and common methods with polished visuals. Start here before tackling the other collection types.

## Alternative explanations

- **Python Dictionaries** by Socratica (~8 min)
  Covers dictionaries from creation to iteration, including keys(), values(), items(), and practical use cases. Same polished Socratica style -- great for learners who prefer short, focused videos over long-form courses.

- **Python Tuples** by Socratica (~4 min)
  Explains what makes tuples different from lists (immutability), when to use them, and tuple packing/unpacking. Short and to the point.

## Deep dives

- **Sets in Python** by Socratica (~5 min)
  Covers set creation, membership testing, union, intersection, and difference operations. Sets are the least intuitive collection type for beginners, and Socratica makes the concept accessible.

- **Python Full Course** by Bro Code (~12 hrs full course)
  Bro Code's full course includes dedicated chapters on lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries with practical examples. Use video timestamp chapters to jump to each collection type. Good for learners who want more practice time with each type.
