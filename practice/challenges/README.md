# Coding Challenges

Standalone coding challenges to sharpen your Python skills. Each challenge is a single file with a problem description, function stub, hints, and built-in tests.

## How It Works

1. **Read the docstring** at the top of each challenge file for the problem description and examples.
2. **Implement the function** where it says `pass`.
3. **Run the file** with `python <filename>.py` -- the built-in tests will tell you if your solution is correct.
4. **Check the solution** in `solutions/` only after you have genuinely attempted the problem.

## Difficulty Levels

| Level            | Description                                                      | Prereqs                                    |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Beginner**     | Core Python: variables, strings, lists, loops, conditionals      | Level 0-2 of the curriculum                |
| **Intermediate** | Decorators, generators, classes, async, file I/O, data structures | Level 3-6 of the curriculum                |

## Tips

- Read the entire docstring before writing any code.
- Use the hint only if you are stuck for more than 5 minutes.
- Run the tests frequently as you build up your solution.
- If all tests pass but you are unsure why, trace through your code by hand with the example inputs.
- Compare your passing solution to the provided solution -- there are often multiple valid approaches.

## Estimated Time

- Beginner challenges: 10-30 minutes each
- Intermediate challenges: 30-60 minutes each
