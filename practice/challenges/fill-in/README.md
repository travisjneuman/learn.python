# Fill-In Challenges

Exercises where function stubs are provided — you write the implementation.

## How It Works

1. Open the exercise file. You will see functions with docstrings and
   `# YOUR CODE HERE` markers.
2. Read the docstring carefully — it tells you exactly what the function
   should do, what arguments it takes, and what it returns.
3. Replace `# YOUR CODE HERE` with your implementation.
4. Run the tests to check your work:

   ```bash
   pytest tests/test_01.py -v
   ```

5. If stuck, check `solutions/` for the completed code with explanations.

## Exercise List

| File | Topic | Difficulty |
|------|-------|------------|
| `01_list_filter.py` | Filtering lists by criteria | Beginner |
| `02_dict_builder.py` | Building dicts from parallel lists | Beginner |
| `03_file_reader.py` | Parsing structured text files | Intermediate |
| `04_string_formatter.py` | String formatting and alignment | Intermediate |
| `05_basic_class.py` | Classes, `__init__`, `__str__`, methods | Intermediate |
| `06_error_handler.py` | Try/except, multiple error types | Intermediate |

## Tips

- Read the docstring before writing any code.
- Run the tests frequently — they tell you exactly what is expected.
- Start with the simplest function in each file and work your way up.
- The tests are not trick questions — if your logic is sound, they will pass.
