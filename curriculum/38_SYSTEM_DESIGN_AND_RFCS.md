# 38 - System Design and RFCs (Architecture Judgment Layer)
Home: [README](../README.md)

Elite engineers write, defend, and evolve system designs with traceable reasoning.

## Required artifacts
For every major build, produce:
- Problem statement
- Constraints and assumptions
- Options considered
- Chosen design and rationale
- Risks and mitigations
- Rollout, rollback, and observability plan

## RFC workflow
1. Draft RFC in markdown.
2. Run async review pass (self-review if solo).
3. Resolve all open questions.
4. Freeze version and map to implementation milestones.
5. Record post-launch review against planned outcomes.

## Design drill pack
Run at least 12 drills:
- 4 small-system drills
- 4 scale/resilience drills
- 4 security/compliance drills

Each drill must include:
- sequence diagram or flow map
- data contract
- failure injection plan
- operational runbook

## Pass criteria
- You can defend tradeoffs under counter-questions.
- You can explain why alternatives were rejected.
- Your design is testable, operable, and reversible.
