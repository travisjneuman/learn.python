# 50 - Certification-Grade Completion Protocol (Objective Mastery Standard)
Home: [README](../README.md)

This protocol defines the final standard for claiming mastery from this plan.

## Completion requirements
You must pass all five:
1. Baseline doc chain completion (`01` through `35`).
2. Elite extension completion (`36` through `45`).
3. Universal learner layer completion (`46` through `49`).
4. Project evidence completion (level-0 through level-10 plus elite track).
5. Assessment completion (written, practical, oral defense).

## Final evidence package
- Portfolio links and summaries.
- Capstone outputs and runbooks.
- Test and quality gate records.
- Architecture decision records.
- Incident and remediation logs.

## Pass/fail rubric
Pass when all are true:
1. All required outputs are reproducible.
2. Quality gates pass without manual exception.
3. Tradeoff reasoning is clear and defensible.
4. Failure handling is tested and documented.
5. Remediation loops are closed with evidence.

Fail when any are true:
1. Hidden assumptions block reproducibility.
2. Test coverage is cosmetic.
3. Critical security or reliability controls are missing.
4. Oral defense cannot justify design decisions.

## Post-completion operating cadence
- Weekly: run one project improvement cycle.
- Monthly: publish one new technical artifact.
- Quarterly: run full reassessment and remediation loop.
