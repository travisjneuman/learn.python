# 24 - Mastery Scoring and Gates (Self-Evaluation)
Home: [README](../README.md)

This is your self-scoring system to prevent fake progress.

## Scoring domains
- Depth of understanding
- Build execution quality
- Failure diagnosis quality
- Code quality and testing
- System design maturity

## Score scale
- 0: no capability
- 1: assisted capability
- 2: independent capability
- 3: robust capability
- 4: advanced capability
- 5: expert capability

## Gate pass requirements
- Minimum domain score: 3
- Average domain score: 4+
- Demonstrated artifact for each domain

## Evidence requirements
- runnable project,
- test evidence,
- break/fix notes,
- architecture explanation,
- tradeoff summary.

## Anti-self-delusion checks
- Can you explain why your approach is correct?
- Can you explain at least 2 alternatives and tradeoffs?
- Can someone else run your project from docs only?
- Can you recover from deliberate failure quickly?
