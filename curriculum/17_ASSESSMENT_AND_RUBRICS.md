# 17 - Assessment and Rubrics
Home: [README](../README.md)

This document defines scoring, pass criteria, and badge/certification mapping.

## Scoring framework (weighted)
- Practical execution: 35%
- Debugging and recovery: 20%
- Engineering quality: 20%
- Communication and teach-back: 15%
- Operational readiness: 10%

Total: 100 points.

## Pass thresholds
- Overall score >= 80.
- No domain below 70.

## Domain rubric guidance

### Practical execution (35)
- 90-100: delivers stable outputs and handles edge cases.
- 80-89: consistent output with minor gaps.
- 70-79: can deliver with guidance.
- <70: execution reliability insufficient.

### Debugging and recovery (20)
- 90-100: isolates root cause quickly, fixes safely.
- 80-89: good debug process with small misses.
- 70-79: debug process inconsistent.
- <70: mostly trial-and-error debugging.

### Engineering quality (20)
- 90-100: clean structure, tests, logging, docs.
- 80-89: mostly consistent quality standards.
- 70-79: partial quality implementation.
- <70: fragile or undocumented implementation.

### Communication and teach-back (15)
- 90-100: explains design and tradeoffs clearly.
- 80-89: explains implementation adequately.
- 70-79: explanations incomplete.
- <70: cannot explain approach reliably.

### Operational readiness (10)
- 90-100: runbooks, safety controls, recovery plans are clear.
- 80-89: operational basics present.
- 70-79: partial operational maturity.
- <70: operational risk is high.

## Certification model
- Informal badges:
  - awarded per level completion.
- Internal non-accredited certification:
  - awarded when levels 0-10 and capstone readiness are passed with thresholds.
  - authority/approver: repository owner.
  - validity: permanent unless curriculum policy changes in a future major version.

## Assessment cadence
- Entry check for each level.
- Exit check for each level.
- Capstone gate checks at levels 5, 7, and 10.

## Assessment artifacts
- scoring sheet,
- evidence links,
- remediation recommendations,
- readiness decision.
