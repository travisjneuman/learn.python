# 46 - Accessibility and Learning Profile Playbook (Any Learner, Any Pace)
Home: [README](../README.md)

This guide ensures the plan works for learners with different cognitive styles, confidence levels, and life constraints.

## Core principle
- Do not force one learning style.
- Adapt process, pacing, and feedback loops while keeping quality standards fixed.

## Learning profile categories
1. High-anxiety / low-confidence starters.
2. Attention-variability learners (short focus windows).
3. Reading-heavy fatigue learners (prefer demos and hands-on).
4. Returning adult learners (time-constrained, long breaks between sessions).
5. Fast learners who risk skipping fundamentals.

## Profile-specific operating rules
### Low-confidence starter
- Session length: 25 to 35 minutes.
- End every session with one runnable success.
- Never move on with unresolved environment issues.

### Attention variability
- Use micro-goals: one command, one test, one fix.
- Split long labs into strict checkpoints.
- Use timer blocks: 20 minutes work, 5 minutes reset.

### Reading fatigue
- Run code first, read explanation second.
- Use teach-back voice notes after each micro-lab.
- Keep one-page summaries only.

### Returning adult
- Start each session with 5-minute recap.
- Re-run previous baseline before adding changes.
- Use weekly review to prevent drift.

### Fast but skip-prone
- Mandatory break/fix drills before advancing.
- Mandatory explain-back evidence.
- No pass without reproducible rerun.

## Accessibility guardrails for this repository
1. Every phase can be run in Play, Structured, or Hybrid mode.
2. Every practical phase has break/fix and mastery checks.
3. Every project has explicit run, expected output, and recovery path.
4. Every root doc has deterministic `Next` navigation.

## Daily fallback protocol (when blocked)
1. Return to last known-good run.
2. Reproduce failure in smallest possible case.
3. Capture root cause in one sentence.
4. Apply one fix only.
5. Re-run test and baseline command.
