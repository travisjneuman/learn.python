# 45 - Mastery Telemetry and Remediation (Never Drift, Always Improve)
Home: [README](../README.md)

Sustained mastery is a measurement and correction loop.

## Telemetry framework
Track at minimum:
- build reliability rate
- test quality trend
- defect escape rate
- performance regression trend
- incident recovery speed
- communication clarity score

## Quarterly loop
1. Collect evidence from all projects and assessments.
2. Score each competency category.
3. Flag weak zones below threshold.
4. Assign focused remediation sprints.
5. Re-test and close only with evidence.

## Threshold model
- Green: 90 to 100
- Yellow: 75 to 89
- Red: below 75

No category can remain red for two consecutive quarters.

## Integration with this repository
- Use [33_WEEKLY_REVIEW_TEMPLATE.md](./33_WEEKLY_REVIEW_TEMPLATE.md) weekly.
- Use [34_FAILURE_RECOVERY_ATLAS.md](./34_FAILURE_RECOVERY_ATLAS.md) when stalled.
- Use [37_QUARTERLY_EXAMS_AND_DEFENSES.md](./37_QUARTERLY_EXAMS_AND_DEFENSES.md) for formal reassessment.
