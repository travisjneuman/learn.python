# 41 - Performance Engineering Lab (Latency, Throughput, Efficiency)
Home: [README](../README.md)

World-class engineering includes predictable performance under load.

## Performance objectives
- Define budgets (latency, memory, CPU, query time).
- Measure before optimizing.
- Optimize with evidence and rollback safety.

## Lab sequence
1. Establish baseline benchmarks.
2. Identify top bottlenecks (code + SQL + IO).
3. Apply targeted optimization passes.
4. Re-benchmark and compare deltas.
5. Guard with performance regression tests.

## Required outputs
- Benchmark report before/after.
- Query profile analysis and tuned variants.
- Performance runbook with thresholds and actions.
