- Minor: content additions and improvements.
- Patch: typo, link, formatting, and non-structural fixes.

## Quarterly release process
1. Gather manual progress notes and feedback.
2. Prioritize high-impact fixes.
3. Run quality gates:
  - markdown links,
  - smoke checks,
  - readability audit,
  - rubric consistency check.
4. Publish release notes.

## Ownership
