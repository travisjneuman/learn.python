# 49 - Competency Coverage and Gap Closure Matrix (No Blind Spots)
Home: [README](../README.md)

Use this matrix to confirm every core competency is trained, tested, and evidenced.

## Competency categories
1. Python language fundamentals.
2. Testing and debugging discipline.
3. Data handling and file automation.
4. SQL and data pipeline reliability.
5. API integration and service design.
6. Security and secret handling.
7. Observability and incident response.
8. Performance and scalability.
9. Architecture communication and tradeoffs.

## Evidence mapping rule
Each competency needs all three:
1. Build evidence (working project output).
2. Quality evidence (tests/checks/runbooks).
3. Communication evidence (explain-back or design note).

## Gap closure protocol
1. Score each competency 0 to 5.
2. Identify lowest two categories.
3. Assign two-week remediation with specific docs/projects.
4. Re-test and re-score.

## Minimum world-class threshold
- No category below 4.
- At least three categories at 5.
- Demonstrated cross-category integration in capstones.
