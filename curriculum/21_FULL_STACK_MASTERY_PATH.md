# 21 - Full-Stack Python Mastery Path (Advanced + Infinite)
Home: [README](../README.md)

This is the high-ceiling path for mastering Python beyond the baseline roadmap.

## Goal
Progress from "can build working tools" to "can design, ship, and evolve production-grade Python systems across backend, data, APIs, automation, and web applications."

## How to use this document
1. Complete baseline roadmap through level-10 projects.
2. Enter this path at Phase A.
3. Work one phase at a time.
4. Do not skip deliverables.
5. Run the infinite mastery loop after Phase G.

## Phase A - Language depth and internals (6-10 weeks)
What to master:
- object model, dunder methods, descriptors,
- iterators/generators,
- context managers,
- decorators,
- typing and static analysis,
- memory/performance basics.

Deliverables:
- implement a mini plugin framework,
- implement custom iterator + context manager,
- pass strict lint/type/test gates.

## Phase B - Backend APIs and service architecture (8-12 weeks)
What to master:
- FastAPI service design,
- API contracts and versioning,
- auth patterns,
- background jobs,
- service boundaries and modular architecture.

Deliverables:
- production-style API with tests,
- request validation and error model,
- structured logging and runbook.

## Phase C - Data engineering and ETL at scale (8-12 weeks)
What to master:
- idempotent ETL design,
- schema evolution,
- data quality contracts,
- batch vs incremental loading,
- pipeline observability.

Deliverables:
- staging/reporting/mart flow,
- drift detection and alerting,
- replay-safe ingestion jobs.

## Phase D - Frontend-in-Python delivery (6-10 weeks)
What to master:
- Streamlit and Dash architecture patterns,
- state/filter design,
- caching and responsiveness,
- user-centered dashboard design.

Deliverables:
- multi-page dashboard with exports,
- role-based view simulation,
- stale-data and degraded-mode handling.

## Phase E - Reliability, security, and performance (8-12 weeks)
What to master:
- threat modeling basics,
- secret handling patterns,
- retry/backoff/circuit-breaker concepts,
- profiling and optimization,
- failure-mode testing.

Deliverables:
- resilience test report,
- security checklist pass,
- performance baseline + improvements.

## Phase F - Distributed systems and architecture thinking (8-12 weeks)
What to master:
- event-driven workflows,
- asynchronous processing,
- consistency tradeoffs,
- system boundaries and integration strategy.

Deliverables:
- architecture decision records (ADRs),
- event processing simulation,
- incident postmortem package.

## Phase G - Product-grade capstone portfolio (10-16 weeks)
Build 3 flagship systems:
1. API-first platform service.
2. Data pipeline with governance controls.
3. Full-stack operational web application.

For each system include:
- docs,
- tests,
- quality checks,
- runbooks,
- deployment and recovery guidance.

## Mastery checkpoints (hard gates)
- Gate M1: language depth verified.
- Gate M2: backend/API architecture verified.
- Gate M3: data pipeline reliability verified.
- Gate M4: full-stack app quality verified.
- Gate M5: system design and operational maturity verified.
