# 25 - Infinity Mastery Loop (Never Plateau)
Home: [README](../README.md)

After reaching expert-level competency, use this loop continuously.

## The loop
1. Build
- Ship one meaningful new system or enhancement.

2. Break
- Inject realistic failures.
- Validate resilience and recovery.

3. Diagnose
- Perform root-cause analysis.
- Write precise failure notes.

4. Refactor
- Improve architecture, quality, and clarity.

5. Teach yourself back
- Explain design and tradeoffs in writing.

6. Benchmark
- Compare against previous quality and performance.

7. Upgrade
- Add one advanced concept you previously avoided.

## Monthly rhythm
- Week 1: new build feature.
- Week 2: hardening and tests.
- Week 3: failure drills and recovery.
- Week 4: refactor and benchmark.

## Annual rhythm
- Q1: language and architecture depth.
- Q2: data and scale depth.
- Q3: reliability/security/performance depth.
- Q4: capstone refresh and portfolio upgrades.

## Infinite mastery principles
- Never stop at "it works".
- Prefer understanding over memorization.
- Prefer repeatability over heroics.
- Prefer clarity over cleverness.
