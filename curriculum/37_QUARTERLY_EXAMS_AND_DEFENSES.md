# 37 - Quarterly Exams and Defenses (Written + Practical + Oral)
Home: [README](../README.md)

You cannot claim elite mastery without recurring, strict assessments.

## Exam model
Every quarter run three components:
1. Written exam (90 minutes)
2. Practical build/fix exam (4 to 6 hours)
3. Oral defense (45 to 60 minutes)

## Scoring model
- Written: 30%
- Practical: 50%
- Oral defense: 20%
- Pass threshold: 85% overall and no component below 75%.

## Written exam blueprint
Include scenario-based prompts on:
- Python internals and runtime behavior
- Data structures and algorithmic complexity
- Reliability and error handling design
- SQL and transaction safety
- Security and secrets handling

## Practical exam blueprint
Use one constrained task:
- Ingest + transform + serve + monitor a realistic dataset
- Add test suite, lint/format checks, logging, and runbook
- Simulate one failure mode and recover

## Oral defense blueprint
Candidate must explain:
- architecture tradeoffs
- rejected alternatives
- failure boundaries
- rollout and rollback plan

## Remediation rules
If fail:
1. Log root cause by category (knowledge, execution, communication).
2. Assign 2-week remediation sprint.
3. Re-test only failed component after sprint.
