# 36 - Elite Engineering Track (From Strong to World-Class)
Home: [README](../README.md)

Path placeholder: `<repo-root>` means the folder containing this repository's `README.md`.

This phase turns senior-level execution into top-tier engineering judgment.

## Why this exists
- Mastery is not just coding speed.
- Elite engineers optimize reliability, scalability, security, operability, and organizational leverage.
- This track formalizes those capabilities with hard gates.

## Elite outcomes
By the end of this track you can:
1. Design systems with clear tradeoffs and failure boundaries.
2. Build and defend production-grade architectures.
3. Lead deep technical reviews with evidence.
4. Improve team quality through standards, automation, and mentorship.
