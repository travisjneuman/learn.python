## How to Help

We welcome translation contributions. See [TRANSLATING.md](./TRANSLATING.md) for the complete guide on how to translate this curriculum.

## Translation Priority

Translate these documents first (in order):

1. `README.md` -- the main landing page
2. `START_HERE.md` -- the first thing learners read
3. `00_COMPUTER_LITERACY_PRIMER.md` -- essential for absolute beginners
4. `GETTING_STARTED.md` -- setup and pacing guidance
5. Level 00 exercises -- the first hands-on experience
6. `concepts/` guides -- reference material learners revisit often

## Directory Structure

Each translation lives in its own subdirectory named by language code:

```
translations/
  README.md           -- this file
  TRANSLATING.md      -- guide for translators
  es/                 -- Spanish
    README.md
  pt-BR/              -- Brazilian Portuguese
    README.md
```

Translated files mirror the source repo structure within each language directory.
