# 16 - Learner Profile and Placement
Home: [README](./README.md)

This document defines how a learner is placed into the right entry level and pace without assumptions.

## Goals
- Minimize false starts.
- Reduce confidence loss.
- Match difficulty to learner readiness.

## Intake questionnaire (core)
Use these sections at onboarding:

1. Digital baseline
- Have you used command-line tools before? (`never`, `sometimes`, `often`)
- Comfort installing software? (`low`, `medium`, `high`)

2. Learning preference
- Prefer reading, watching, building, or teaching?
- Can you tolerate frequent failure while learning? (`low`, `medium`, `high`)

3. Time and consistency
- Weekly available hours (`<4`, `4-8`, `8-12`, `12+`)
- Session style (`short daily`, `long weekend`, `mixed`)

4. Motivation and outcomes
- Primary goal (`job`, `career-change`, `curiosity`, `teaching`, `other`)
- Time horizon (`3 months`, `6 months`, `12 months+`)

5. Environment constraints
- Windows access? local admin? internet reliability?
- Corporate restrictions on installs/APIs?

## Placement model

### Entry level recommendation
- Start at Level 0 if any are true:
  - no command-line experience,
  - low install confidence,
  - low failure tolerance.
- Start at Level 1 if:
  - basic command-line familiarity,
  - can run scripts with guidance.
- Start at Level 2+ only if:
  - can independently run Python scripts,
  - can read tracebacks and fix simple bugs.

### Pace recommendation
- Slow pace: `<4 hrs/week`
- Standard pace: `4-8 hrs/week`
- Accelerated pace: `8-12 hrs/week`
- Intensive pace: `12+ hrs/week`

## Support overlays
- Confidence support overlay:
  - micro-wins,
  - short checkpoints,
  - explain-before-build prompts.
- Recovery overlay:
  - break/fix drills,
  - root-cause templates,
  - anti-panic troubleshooting cards.

## Reassessment cadence
- Reassess every 2 weeks during levels 0-2.
- Reassess monthly from levels 3-10.
- Reassess immediately after any multi-week stall.
