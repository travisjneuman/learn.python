Welcome. This will take 10 minutes.

## Step 1: Install Python
Open [03_SETUP_ALL_PLATFORMS.md](./03_SETUP_ALL_PLATFORMS.md) and follow the instructions for your computer (Windows, Mac, or Linux). When `python --version` works in your terminal, come back here.

## Step 2: Do your first exercise
Open your terminal and run:
```
cd projects/level-00-absolute-beginner/01-first-steps
python exercise.py
```

If you see output, you are ready. Work through exercises 01-15 in order.

## Step 3: Follow the numbers
When you finish level-00, follow the numbered documents starting with [00_COMPUTER_LITERACY_PRIMER.md](./00_COMPUTER_LITERACY_PRIMER.md) if you need it, or [01_ROADMAP.md](./01_ROADMAP.md) if you are comfortable.

Every document has a "Next" link at the bottom. Follow it.

## Can't install Python yet?
Try our browser-based exercises at [browser/index.html](./browser/index.html). They run real Python in your browser with no installation needed. Your code is saved automatically so you can pick up where you left off.

## Never done this before?
Read [00_COMPUTER_LITERACY_PRIMER.md](./00_COMPUTER_LITERACY_PRIMER.md) first. It explains what a terminal, file, and program are.
