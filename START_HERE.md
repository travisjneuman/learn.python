Welcome. This will take 10 minutes.

## Step 1: Install Python
Open [03_SETUP_ALL_PLATFORMS.md](./03_SETUP_ALL_PLATFORMS.md) and follow the instructions for your computer (Windows, Mac, or Linux). When `python --version` works in your terminal, come back here.

## Step 2: Do your first exercise
Open your terminal and run:
```
cd projects/level-00-absolute-beginner/01-first-steps
python exercise.py
```

If you see output, you are ready. Work through exercises 01-15 in order.

## Step 3: Follow the numbers
When you finish level-00, follow the numbered documents starting with [00_COMPUTER_LITERACY_PRIMER.md](./00_COMPUTER_LITERACY_PRIMER.md) if you need it, or [01_ROADMAP.md](./01_ROADMAP.md) if you are comfortable.

Every document has a "Next" link at the bottom. Follow it.

## Can't install Python yet?
Try our browser-based exercises at [browser/index.html](./browser/index.html). They run real Python in your browser with no installation needed. Your code is saved automatically so you can pick up where you left off.

## Practice Tools

Beyond the main projects, the curriculum includes several ways to reinforce what you learn:

- **Quizzes** — Test your understanding of each concept: [`concepts/quizzes/`](./concepts/quizzes/)
- **Flashcards** — Quick-review decks for key terms and patterns: [`practice/flashcards/`](./practice/flashcards/)
- **Challenges** — Standalone problems sorted by difficulty: [`practice/challenges/`](./practice/challenges/)
- **Browser Exercises** — Run Python in your browser with no install: [`browser/`](./browser/index.html)
- **Spaced Repetition** — SM-2 algorithm to schedule reviews: [`tools/spaced_repetition.py`](./tools/spaced_repetition.py)

## Never done this before?
Read [00_COMPUTER_LITERACY_PRIMER.md](./00_COMPUTER_LITERACY_PRIMER.md) first. It explains what a terminal, file, and program are.
