# 19 - Mentor Guide
Home: [README](./README.md)

This guide supports optional mentoring while preserving self-paced default behavior.

## Mentor operating mode
- Self-paced is default.
- Mentor engagement is opt-in.
- Mentor role: unblock, calibrate, enforce quality, build confidence.
- Recommendation: use mentor support only when learner requests help or hits remediation triggers.

## Session cadence options
- Light-touch: 30 minutes biweekly.
- Standard: 45-60 minutes weekly.
- Intensive: 2 sessions weekly during remediation.

## Session structure
1. 5 min: learner summary and blockers.
2. 20 min: live review of one project.
3. 15 min: break/fix drill.
4. 10 min: next actions and confidence reset.

## Mentor checklist
- verify learner can run project end-to-end,
- verify learner can explain key decisions,
- verify learner can identify one failure mode and mitigation,
- assign one focused improvement task.

## Escalation triggers
- repeated failure without improved reasoning,
- severe confidence decline,
- long inactivity.

## Handoff notes template
- learner current level,
- key strengths,
- recurring blockers,
- next two interventions,
- reassessment date.
