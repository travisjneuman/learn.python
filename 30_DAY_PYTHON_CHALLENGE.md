# 30-Day Python Challenge

Home: [README](./README.md)

A curated 30-day path through the learn.python curriculum. Spend 30 to 60 minutes per day. By day 30, you will have written real Python programs, passed real tests, and built something from scratch.

**Prerequisites:** A computer with Python 3.11+ installed. If you have not installed Python yet, follow [03_SETUP_ALL_PLATFORMS.md](./03_SETUP_ALL_PLATFORMS.md) first.

**Rules for Day 30:**
1. Start from an empty `.py` file
2. Use at least 3 concepts from the curriculum (functions, file I/O, error handling, etc.)
3. Write at least one test
4. Write a one-paragraph description of what you built in a `notes.md` file

---

## After the Challenge

Congratulations. You have written real Python programs, passed real tests, and built something from scratch. Here is what to do next:

1. **Continue the curriculum.** You are partway through Level 2. Finish it, then move to Level 3.
2. **Try an expansion module.** [Web Scraping](./projects/modules/01-web-scraping/) and [CLI Tools](./projects/modules/02-cli-tools/) are great next steps.
3. **Review with flashcards daily.** Even 5 minutes of spaced repetition builds lasting knowledge.
4. **Share what you built on Day 30.** Open a discussion on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/travisjneuman/learn.python/discussions) and show your project.

---

## Tips for Success

- **Consistency beats intensity.** 30 minutes every day is better than 4 hours on Saturday.
- **Type the code yourself.** Do not copy-paste. Typing builds muscle memory.
- **Read error messages.** They are not punishment. They are directions.
- **Take notes.** Every project has a `notes.md` file. Use it.
- **It is okay to repeat a day.** If you did not understand something, do it again tomorrow.
